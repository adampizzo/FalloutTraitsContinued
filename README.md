Adds 71 new perks to Rimworld based on the theme from fallout games. Updated to 1.5. I updated the traits XML and updated the required mods in the about XML, but the rest of the work on the traits and patching XML goes to FuglyPump.

Latest Update - Changed traits using MeleeDodgeChance to integers, similar to the vanilla Nimble trait. Thank you to Supergob for pointing that out.

Previous Update - Removed the requirements for Carry Capacity Fixed (Continued). If you do not run CCF then it will not add in the traits that are required to use it.
